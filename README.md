# WeylGroup
Maple script for Weyl group related computation


This script requires the “coxeter and weyl package” and "posets package" by J.Stembridge.
Download the "Vanilla" editions from:

* http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/maple.html

rename it to “coxeter.txt” and "posets.txt"
and place in the same directory as the script file.

Download "traverse" example as well from below

* http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/software/coxexamples.html

and rename it to "traverse.txt"
